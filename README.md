Sample mod 4 code challenge

Please complete the 3 instructions below.  You have (20) min.

1.  In what order will the numbers 1-4 be logged to the console when the code below is executed? Why?

    ```js
    (function() {
        console.log(1);
        setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000);
        setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0);
        console.log(4);
    })();
    ```

2.  Describe two ways you can fix the following greet method to output correctly:

    ```js
    const person = {
        firstName: 'bob',
        greet: function() {
          return function reallyGreet() {
            return `Hi, I'm ${this.firstName}`
          }
        }
      }
      person.greet()()
      // Hi, I'm undefined
    ```

3.  Create a StarWarsCharacter class using ES6 syntax.  Characters should have name, species, and home world.  Have a quick look at the Star Wars API (https://swapi.co/).  Use fetch requests and the SW API to create 3 StarWarsCharacter objects and display their data in the div with id 'star-wars' (you can just grab the first three people if you like).  You may display the data in any html format you wish.  Put all code in the star_wars.js file.
